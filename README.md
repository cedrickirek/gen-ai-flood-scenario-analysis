**About This Project:**  
This project aims to significantly enhances my 1st Master's research from 2023, applying advanced techniques in generative AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

**More details on some of the files in the main directory:**  
_"Slides_research-project.pdf": The slides for the research project containing good explanations and visuals
_ "model part of my MASTER'S THESIS": This is the section of the thesis where the regression model and the methods for the waste quantification are defined.  
_ "executive_summary_research_project.pdf": Summary of the key findings  

**Background:**  
The original goal was to develop a regression model to predict post-flood waste generation (in tons) in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. (More information can be found in the file "research thesis abstract". Floods cause deadly damage almost every year during the rainy season, yet decision-makers do not possess effective quantitative methods for prevention and planning.

**The Challenge:**  
Zero publicly available data existed on historical post-flood waste generation in Côte d'Ivoire. Consequently, I deterministically estimated waste amounts using heuristic methods before any modeling could begin. Those methods relied on the only data available for a city close to Abidjan in terms of ecosystem: Bangkok.  

**Current Objectives:**  
It was obvious that using generative for synthetic data generation with certain specifities was going to be very relevant. Hence, this enhanced version addresses the data scarcity problem with modern techniques:  
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use generative AI to create realistic flood data for both input features and target variables
2. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance and explainability of various models (white-box vs. black-box approaches)
