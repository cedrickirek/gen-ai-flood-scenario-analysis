This work aims to drastically improve my 1st Master's research project (back in 2023) with my deepened knowledge in generative A.I., Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 
The research project goal was to develop from scratch a regression model to predict the amount of waste (kg) generated after floods in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.   
This was (still is) a crucial issue in this country, as there are almost every year deadly damages during the rainy season. Unfortunately, none to a few quantitatively-based methods are used by people of power to prevent casualties. 
Unfortunately, there was ZERO publicly available information on past data regarding the amount of waste generated in Cote d'Ivoire after floods. The biggest part was to deterministically estimate the amount of waste generated aafter floods officially recorded before building the regression model. I succedeed to do all this with a lot of heuristic methods, but it was obvious that using generative A.I. for synthetic data generation with certain specifities was going to be extremel;y relevant.
Hence, now, the two main objectives are: generating synthetic flood data for both the explanatory and explained variables, and compare the performance and explainability of different models (white and black box models)
